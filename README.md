# Theme of my Geo-game
Firstly, I preferred a guess-based game to design. In general, it will be looking like the famous geographic guessing game called GeoGuessr. 
General desing of the game will contain darkened map shapes from each country. Also there will be a hint/clue system that gives a city from the country that user's trying to find. During the finding idea phase was little bit tough for me. I changed my mind 2 times. This one is the last and current one that I'm about to use. In general, game will be based on a time-limited country-guess game by it's shape.
# Front-End Requirements
Decide phase will take a little time but at least the idea' requirements are not far from each other. So the coding can make me easily choose one of them. First and most important part is the map. There must be a moveable interactive map. Google Maps API or Openlayers and React.js can be useful while coding. In general, main page would probably look like two parts. One part will have the given images, blanks to fill and other page-based datas(last earned points, highest score). Other part will have the interactive map and in-game cursor to move or make a guess and submit button. User also can see the remaining time for round.
