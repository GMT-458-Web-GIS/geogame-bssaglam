# General Design and Logic 

### 1. User Interface (UI) Design:
* Responsive Design: The game should be responsive to different screen sizes, providing a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
* Visual Appeal: Images of dishes, people, and landmarks are important for user engagement. The design must maintain consistency and clarity in displaying these visuals.
* Feedback System: Visual and audio feedback after each guess (correct or incorrect) is necessary to keep users motivated and informed.
### 2. Gameplay Functionality:
* Clue Display: The game should randomly display clues (dish, person, or place) with corresponding images and titles.
* Progress Tracking: The game should track the user’s score and the round they’re on, providing progression indicators.
* Answer Checking: The game should check the user’s input against the correct answer (country) and give feedback accordingly.
Sound Effects: Correct and incorrect sounds enhance the experience, providing audio feedback for the player’s actions.
### 3. Content Management:
* Diverse Content: A collection of clues (countries, dishes, landmarks, people, and fun facts) should be sufficiently diverse and informative, ensuring players learn while playing.
* Flag Images: Flag images for each country should be available to display after correct answers
