# Theme of my Geo-game
Firstly, I preferred a guess-based game to design. In general, it will be looking like the famous geographic guessing game called GeoGuessr. 
General desing of the game will contain culinary context. I haven't decided the next phase of game but I have two similar ideas.
## First Idea
First one is player gets an image of a worldwide-famous or specifically local-famous meal. Then player will have some time to think about it and can drag her/his cursor to map. At the end, player submits her/his guess on map which should be the origin of the meal. Depending the distance her/his submitted guess location, he/she'll get points.
## Second Idea
Second one is player can move around the city given. After some walking around, he/she should submit the guess but after guessing game won't end. Player should guess that region's meal given as blank to fill.
Also player can request hints to guess easily. 
Decide phase will take a little time but at least these ideas' requirements are not far from each other. So the coding can make me easily choose one of them.
