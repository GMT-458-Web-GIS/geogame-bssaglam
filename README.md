# Front-End Requirements
Decide phase will take a little time but at least the idea' requirements are not far from each other. So the coding can make me easily choose one of them. First and most important part is the map. There must be a moveable interactive map. Google Maps API or Openlayers and React.js can be useful while coding. In general, main page would probably look like two parts. One part will have the given images, blanks to fill and other page-based datas(last earned points, highest score). Other part will have the interactive map and in-game cursor to move or make a guess and submit button. User also can see the remaining time for round.
